## 2. Current State Analysis

### 2.1 Domain Architecture Assessment

**Existing Strengths**:
- ✅ Pure domain models (Card, Hand, StrategyEngine)
- ✅ Immutable data structures with functional transformations
- ✅ Rich Hand calculations (soft/hard values, blackjack detection)
- ✅ Comprehensive strategy engine with proper basic strategy implementation
- ✅ Strong test coverage for core domain logic

**Critical Architectural Flaws Identified**:

#### 2.1.1 Anemic Round Model
**Problem**: The `Round` class is a pure data container without behavior
```kotlin
// Current: Anemic domain model
data class Round(
    val playerHand: Hand,
    val dealerHand: Hand, 
    val bet: Int,
    val phase: RoundPhase
) // No behavior, no business logic
```

**Impact**: Business logic scattered across service layer, violating DDD principles

#### 2.1.2 Incomplete Round Lifecycle
**Problem**: Missing critical game states and transitions
- No dealer play automation
- No split hand management
- No state transition validation
- No round outcome calculation

#### 2.1.3 Broken Statistics System
**Problem**: Statistics count individual decisions, not complete rounds
```kotlin
// Current: Misleading statistics
fun recordDecision(isCorrect: Boolean): SessionStats = copy(
    totalDecisions = totalDecisions + 1, // Individual actions
    correctDecisions = correctDecisions + if (isCorrect) 1 else 0
)
```

**Impact**: Incorrect performance metrics and user progress tracking

#### 2.1.4 Missing Rich Domain Concepts
**Absent Domain Entities**:
- Training session with learning objectives
- Decision history with detailed context
- Strategy explanations with reasoning
- Rule configurations affecting strategy calculations

### 2.2 Technical Architecture Strengths
- ✅ Kotlin Multiplatform with Compose UI
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns (Domain/Presentation)
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite with TDD practices
- ✅ Immutable data structures and functional programming principles

## 4. Rich Domain Model Specifications

### 4.1 Domain Model Improvements

The current domain model needs significant enrichment to move from anemic to rich domain design:

#### 4.1.1 Rich Round Aggregate

**Current Problem**: Anemic Round class without behavior
**Solution**: Rich Round aggregate with complete lifecycle management

```kotlin
// Rich Round aggregate with behavior
class Round private constructor(
    val id: RoundId,
    private val _playerHands: MutableList<PlayerHand>,
    private val _dealerHand: DealerHand,
    private val _bet: ChipAmount,
    private var _phase: RoundPhase,
    private val _decisions: MutableList<PlayerDecision>,
    private val _rules: GameRules
) {
    // Rich behavior instead of anemic data
    fun makeDecision(action: Action, handIndex: Int = 0): DecisionResult
    fun completePlayerTurn(): Round  
    fun playDealerTurn(): Round
    fun calculateOutcome(): RoundOutcome
    fun canSplit(handIndex: Int): Boolean
    fun availableActions(handIndex: Int): Set<Action>
    
    // Domain invariants and validation
    init {
        validateRoundState()
    }
    
    // State transitions with business rules
    private fun transitionTo(newPhase: RoundPhase): Round
}
```

#### 4.1.2 Enhanced Value Objects

**PlayerDecision Value Object**:
```kotlin
data class PlayerDecision(
    val handSnapshot: HandSnapshot,
    val dealerUpCard: Card,
    val actionTaken: Action,
    val optimalAction: Action,
    val isCorrect: Boolean,
    val reasoning: StrategyReasoning,
    val timestamp: Instant
) {
    val feedback: DecisionFeedback get() = DecisionFeedback.create(this)
    val impactOnExpectedValue: Double get() = calculateEVImpact()
}
```

**StrategyReasoning Value Object**:
```kotlin
data class StrategyReasoning(
    val handType: HandType, // PAIR, SOFT, HARD
    val strategicPrinciple: StrategyPrinciple,
    val expectedValueCalculation: EVCalculation,
    val explanation: String,
    val confidence: ConfidenceLevel
)
```

#### 4.1.3 Training Session Aggregate

**New Rich Domain Concept**:
```kotlin
class TrainingSession private constructor(
    val id: SessionId,
    private val _rounds: MutableList<CompletedRound>,
    private val _currentRound: Round?,
    private var _chipBalance: ChipAmount,
    private val _configuration: TrainingConfiguration,
    private var _statistics: SessionStatistics
) {
    // Rich training behavior
    fun startNewRound(betAmount: ChipAmount): TrainingSession
    fun completeCurrentRound(): TrainingSession  
    fun calculateLearningProgress(): LearningProgress
    fun identifyWeakAreas(): List<StrategicArea>
    fun generateRecommendations(): List<TrainingRecommendation>
    
    // Domain rules and constraints
    val canContinue: Boolean get() = _chipBalance >= ChipAmount.MINIMUM_BET
    val masteryLevel: MasteryLevel get() = calculateMasteryLevel()
}
```

### 4.2 Domain Services

#### 4.2.1 Strategy Calculation Service
```kotlin
class StrategyCalculationService(
    private val basicStrategyEngine: BasicStrategyEngine,
    private val ruleVariationEngine: RuleVariationEngine
) {
    fun calculateOptimalAction(
        situation: GameSituation,
        rules: GameRules
    ): StrategyDecision
    
    fun explainDecision(
        decision: StrategyDecision,
        situation: GameSituation
    ): StrategyReasoning
}
```

#### 4.2.2 Learning Progress Service  
```kotlin
class LearningProgressService {
    fun assessProgress(session: TrainingSession): LearningAssessment
    fun identifyPatterns(decisions: List<PlayerDecision>): List<LearningPattern>
    fun recommendNextSteps(assessment: LearningAssessment): List<TrainingRecommendation>
}
```

### 4.3 Domain Events

```kotlin
sealed class RoundEvent : DomainEvent {
    data class RoundStarted(val roundId: RoundId, val bet: ChipAmount) : RoundEvent()
    data class DecisionMade(val decision: PlayerDecision) : RoundEvent()  
    data class RoundCompleted(val outcome: RoundOutcome) : RoundEvent()
    data class MasteryAchieved(val area: StrategicArea) : RoundEvent()
}
```

## 5. Implementation Guidance

### 5.1 DDD + TDD Implementation Strategy

#### 5.1.1 Phase 1: Rich Domain Foundation (2-3 weeks)
**Objectives**: Transform anemic domain to rich domain models
**TDD Approach**: Red-Green-Refactor with domain behavior focus

**Priority Order**:
1. **Rich Round Aggregate** - Complete round lifecycle with state transitions
2. **Enhanced PlayerDecision** - Rich value objects with behavior
3. **TrainingSession Aggregate** - Learning progress and session management
4. **Domain Services** - Strategy calculation and learning assessment

**TDD Guidelines**:
- Start with behavior tests, not data tests
- Test domain invariants and business rules
- Use Given-When-Then format for clarity
- Maintain 100% test coverage for domain layer

#### 5.1.2 Phase 2: Application Layer + CQRS (2-4 weeks)
**Trigger Conditions**: UI complexity increases OR statistics requirements expand
**Focus**: Command/Query separation with rich domain integration

#### 5.1.3 Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)
**Trigger Conditions**: Multi-user requirements OR complex state management needs
**Focus**: Event Sourcing and advanced CQRS patterns

### 5.2 Development Principles Application

#### 5.2.1 SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each aggregate handles one core concept (Round, Session)
- **Open/Closed**: Strategy engine extensible for rule variations
- **Liskov Substitution**: Strategy implementations interchangeable
- **Interface Segregation**: Separate interfaces for different client needs
- **Dependency Inversion**: Domain depends on abstractions, not implementations

#### 5.2.2 DDD Patterns
- **Rich Aggregates**: Round and TrainingSession with business behavior
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects with domain meaning (PlayerDecision, ChipAmount)
- **Domain Services**: Complex calculations spanning multiple aggregates  
- **Domain Events**: Communication between bounded contexts
- **Repositories**: Data access abstraction respecting aggregate boundaries

#### 5.2.3 Anti-Pattern Prevention
- **No Anemic Domain Models**: All domain objects have behavior, not just data
- **No Domain Logic in Services**: Business rules belong in aggregates
- **No Primitive Obsession**: Use value objects for domain concepts
- **No Feature Envy**: Keep related data and behavior together

### 5.3 Architecture Decision Framework

#### 5.3.1 Decision Criteria
1. **Domain Richness**: Does this enhance domain model expressiveness?
2. **Test Coverage**: Can this be thoroughly tested with fast unit tests?
3. **YAGNI Compliance**: Is this needed for current requirements?
4. **KISS Principle**: Is this the simplest solution that works?

#### 5.3.2 Implementation Checkpoints
- **Before each class**: Define its responsibility and behavior
- **Before each method**: Write failing test first
- **Before each commit**: Verify all tests pass and domain rules are preserved
- **Before each merge**: Review for domain modeling improvements
